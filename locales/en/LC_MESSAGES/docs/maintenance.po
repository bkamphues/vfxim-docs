"*RTD* documentation pages are written in a format called "
"`ReStructuredText <https://thomas-"
"cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_. *ReST* is a markup "
"language which means that some characters like an asterisk (#) or an "
"underscore (_) have a different meaning. You may have seen a similiar "
"markup language like *HTML* or *Markdown* in use on websites or GitHub "
"repositories. It takes time to get the hang of writing in *ReST*, but "
"with the help of this `cheatsheet <https://thomas-"
"cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_ you'll get the gist of"
" it quickly. It is recommended to use an *IDE* that supports syntax "
"highlighting for *ReST* so it will tell you when you correctly type "
"directives. This `Visual Studio Code extension "
"<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext>`_"
" takes care of that for you."
